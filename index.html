<br/>
Welcome to my page. I just learned HTML and now I am experimenting with that. 
The links above are the sites I visit most often, or should be...Or want to be. 
In any case, I hope you enjoy my page that I designed myself! Thank the internet 
or I would still  be hopelessly lost and maybe not have any idea of how to HTML 
code. <img style="float:left;padding:5px;width:240px;height:320px"src="BATMAN 154.JPG">Next stop...JAVA or Flash...or hey, maybe even C++. I want to continue to 
grow my HTML coding skills, as well, which is difficult in the life of a bay 
area teen! I could blabber on all day, but I won't because I would really like 
to get some sleep and possibly get some homework out of the way. By the way, I got 
my SAT scores today, and let's just say I did okay...1930. Still much room for 
improvement. I have no idea where I will go to college, not like I really ever 
did, but I feel even more lost than ever before. This subpar score is not doing 
me any favors as far as helping me to achieve the most options as possible. 
I will admit, it is not hurting my chances, either, but I must be critical of 
myself because I know I can achieve better. In other random news, Mom and Dad 
both got new cell phones, and Bianca will get a smartphone this holiday break. 
Though my contract is also finished, I will not be getting one...yet at least. I
will keep you posted! Anyways, keep it real and fight the power.
